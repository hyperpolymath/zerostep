PALIMPSEST LICENSE
Version 0.8

Copyright (c) 2024 Joshua Jewell

================================================================================
PREAMBLE
================================================================================

The Palimpsest License draws its name from ancient manuscripts where earlier
texts were scraped away to make room for new writing, yet traces of the
original remained visible beneath. Similarly, this license recognizes that
all creative works build upon those that came before, and encourages
transparent attribution of this layered provenance.

This is not a replacement for traditional open source licenses (MIT, GPL, etc.)
but a complementary ethical framework that encourages:

1. Transparent attribution and provenance tracking
2. Collaborative improvement over time
3. Ethical use that benefits the commons
4. Recognition of all contributors in the chain

================================================================================
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
================================================================================

1. ATTRIBUTION CHAIN

   You are encouraged (but not legally required) to:

   a) Maintain a clear record of all modifications and their authors
   b) Preserve attribution to original authors and significant contributors
   c) Document the provenance chain in a machine-readable format
   d) Use SPDX headers and .well-known/provenance.json where applicable

2. COLLABORATIVE IMPROVEMENT

   The spirit of this license encourages:

   a) Sharing improvements back to the community
   b) Constructive collaboration over competitive forking
   c) Mentorship of new contributors
   d) Documentation of lessons learned

3. ETHICAL USE

   Users are encouraged to consider:

   a) The impact of their use on the broader community
   b) Whether their application aligns with the project's values
   c) How their modifications might benefit others
   d) The sustainability of the open source ecosystem

4. TRANSPARENCY

   In the spirit of the palimpsest, where layers remain visible:

   a) Modification history should be preserved (e.g., via Git)
   b) Significant changes should be documented in CHANGELOG
   c) Decision-making processes should be transparent
   d) Governance should be documented and accessible

================================================================================
LEGAL STATUS
================================================================================

This license is PHILOSOPHICALLY ENCOURAGED but NOT LEGALLY BINDING.

The software is provided under a separate legal license (MIT, GPL, or other
SPDX-identified license). The Palimpsest License describes ethical guidelines
and community norms that complement but do not replace the legal license.

Failure to follow Palimpsest principles does not constitute a license
violation, but does represent a departure from the project's values.

================================================================================
SOLIDARITY ECONOMICS
================================================================================

This project operates under solidarity economics principles:

- Contributions are valued beyond monetary compensation
- Community benefit takes precedence over individual profit
- Sustainable funding models are preferred over extractive ones
- Attribution and recognition are forms of compensation

See FUNDING.yml for ways to support sustainable development.

================================================================================
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

- The Free Software Foundation's philosophy of software freedom
- The Open Source Initiative's collaborative model
- The Commons movement's emphasis on shared resources
- The IndieWeb's principles of data ownership
