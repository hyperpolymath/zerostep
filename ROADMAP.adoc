= VAE Dataset Normalizer Roadmap

== Current Status

Active development phase, with core features implemented and nearing a v1.0.0 stable release.

== Milestones

=== v0.1.0 - Foundation
* [x] Core functionality
* [x] Basic documentation
* [x] CI/CD pipeline

=== v1.0.0 - Stable Release
* [x] RSR (Rhodium Standard Repository) compliance
* [x] Full documentation suite (including detailed READMEs, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, GOVERNANCE, ACCOUNTABILITY, REVERSIBILITY)
* [x] **Diff-based compression**: Store VAE images as diffs to reduce dataset size by ~50%
  * [x] `compress`, `decompress`, `reconstruct` subcommands
  * [x] Julia `CompressedVAEDataset` for on-the-fly VAE reconstruction
  * [x] Diff encoding: `diff = VAE - Original + 128`
* [x] **Contrastive learning model** for VAE artifact detection (`contrastive_model.jl`)
  * [x] CNN encoder with ResNet-style residual blocks
  * [x] Projection head for contrastive learning
  * [x] Multiple loss functions: NT-Xent, Supervised Contrastive, Triplet, Contrastive
  * [x] Two-phase training: contrastive pre-training + classifier fine-tuning
  * [x] Binary classifier for original vs VAE discrimination
  * [x] Embedding extraction for visualization
  * [x] Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix
  * [x] GPU support via CUDA.jl (optional)
  * [x] Justfile recipes for training and evaluation
* [ ] Comprehensive tests (Rust unit, integration, fuzz tests; Julia unit tests)
* [ ] Production ready

== Future Directions

Future development will focus on expanding the utility and robustness of the
VAE Dataset Normalizer, driven by community feedback and emerging research needs.
Potential areas include:

*   **Expanded VAE Artifact Detection Models**: Explore alternative contrastive
    learning architectures, semi-supervised approaches, and integration with
    other artifact detection techniques.
*   **Multi-Modal Artifact Detection**: Extend the framework to detect artifacts
    in other data modalities (e.g., text, audio) generated by large models.
*   **Explainability (XAI) for Artifacts**: Develop methods to explain *why*
    a particular image is flagged as a VAE artifact, providing insights into
    the nature of the detected degradation.
*   **Integration with broader ML Ecosystem**: Streamline integration with
    popular ML platforms and tools, potentially through additional language bindings
    or standardized APIs.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize data loading, processing, and
    model inference for even larger datasets and faster turnaround times.
*   **Formal Verification for ML Models**: Expand the application of formal methods
    beyond data splits to verify properties of the ML models themselves, such as
    robustness or fairness.
*   **Community Contributions**: Actively encourage and integrate community-driven
    features and improvements.
