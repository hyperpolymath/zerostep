== Overview

This document describes the governance model for the VAE Dataset Normalizer project.

== Governance Model

This project follows a **Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)** model with community input.

=== Decision Making

==== Day-to-Day Decisions

* Made by active maintainers
* Documented in issues/MRs
* Can be overridden by BDFL if necessary

==== Technical Decisions

* Proposed via RFC (Request for Comments) issues
* Community feedback period: 14 days minimum
* Final decision by maintainers with BDFL tiebreaker

==== Governance Decisions

* Require BDFL approval
* Community input welcomed
* Documented in this file

=== Roles

==== BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life)

* Joshua Jewell
* Final authority on all decisions

==== Contributors

=== Succession Planning

In case the BDFL is unable to continue:
